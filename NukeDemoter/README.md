NukeDemoter
===========
A spell nuking utility tool addon for FFXI Windower
---------------------------------------------------

A utility that automatically downgrades nukes that the player attempts to cast that are either awaiting recast or too MP-expensive to cast, allowing the player to spam their highest tier nukes without mentally processing recasts nor MP.

##### Thank you Masunasu, from FFXIAH, for helping sort out how to replace the casted spell!!!
