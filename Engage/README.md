Engage
======
A single/multi-boxing Utility for FFXI Windower
---------------------------------------------------

A utility that allows the player, or their alt(s), to specifically engage or disengage the target. The vanilla /attack command, on the otherhand, is a pure toggle that cannot be as precisely controlled.
