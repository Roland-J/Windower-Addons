Engage
======
A single/multi-boxing Utility for FFXI Windower
---------------------------------------------------

A utility that allows the player, or their alt(s), to specifically engage or disengage the target. The vanilla /attack command, on the otherhand, is a pure toggle that cannot be as precisely controlled.

Engage commands:
	//engage [commands]
		"on"                   - Engages the player to their target.
		"on send [recipient]"  - Engages recipient to current player\'s target.
		"off"                  - Disengages the player from their target.
		"off send [recipient]" - Disengages recipient from their target.
		"help"                 - Displays this help text.
	 
	 NOTE: The [recipient] can be "@all", "@others", or an alt\'s name.
	 SHORTHAND: Try the "//engage", "//engage s [recipient]", "//disengage", and "//disengage s [recipient]" shorthand commands!
