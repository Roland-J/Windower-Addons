Engage
======
A Single/Multi-boxing Utility for FFXI Windower
-----------------------------------------------

A utility that allows the player, or their alt(s), to specifically engage or disengage the target. The vanilla /attack command, on the otherhand, is a pure toggle that cannot be as precisely controlled.

##### Engage commands:
	//engage on                   - Engages the player to their target.
	//engage on send [recipient]  - Engages recipient to current player\'s target. (Requires the send addon)
	//engage off                  - Disengages the player from their target.
	//engage off send [recipient] - Disengages recipient from their target. (Requires the send addon)
	//engage help                 - Displays this help text.
	
NOTE: The [recipient] can be "@all", "@others", or an alt's name.

SHORTHAND: Try the "//engage", "//engage s [recipient]", "//disengage", and "//disengage s [recipient]" shorthand commands!
